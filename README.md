### RunPod Configuration

#### Basic Pod (Without Persistent Storage)

- **Template**: RunPod CUDA 12.8
- **Container Disk**: 20GB
- **Port**: 8188/http
- **Volume**: Not required
- **Best for**: Quick testing and temporary workloads
  > Note: All data will be lost when pod stops

#### Production Pod (With Persistent Storage)

- **Template**: RunPod CUDA 12.8
- **Container Disk**: 10GB
- **Port**: 8188/http
- **Volume**: 100GB, mount at `/workspace`
- **Best for**: Long-term usage and model storage

> Note: Port 8188 is required for accessing the ComfyUI web interface

### Installation

1. Download the installer script:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JotinKumar/comfyui-runpod-installer/main/install_comfyui_runpod.sh
```

2. Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x install_comfyui_runpod.sh
```

3. Run the installation script:

```bash
./install_comfyui_runpod.sh
```

The installer will automatically download and set up all necessary support scripts and components.
